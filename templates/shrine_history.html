        <p>
           In 1980, when Bastian Nagar was the substation of Gnanaolivupuram parish, the people of this area wanted to have a Grotto for worship. Afterwards they decided to have a Church and a new Parish in future. At that time, the local wealthy parishioner Mr. R. Sebastian was ready to offer 20 cents, a piece of land, for the construction of New Church.As it was not enough, the parish priest of Gnanaolilvupuram, Rev. Fr. M. Dhivyanandam and a group of local parishioners requested Archbishop, Most Rev. Justin Diraviam, to buy a land of 48 cents. The Archbishop accepted and the work was completed in 1986. Having been prepared by Fr. Arul Joseph V., The new parish Bastian Nagar was bifurcated from Gnanaolivupuram on 7th September 1986. The parish is situated in the following directions: Gnanaolivupuram parish (East); Nagamalai Pudukottai parish (West); New Ellis Nagar parish (South); Chirst the King parish (North). It has only one substation, namely Fatima Nagar. The total population of this area is 5000 families, of which the Catholics form 900 families. The parish church was constructed on 09.12.1984.
